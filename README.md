# 8-Bit-Breadboard-CPU

This project is a custom-built **8-bit CPU** assembled on breadboards using TTL logic ICs.  
It is based on Ben Eater’s educational design and schematics, which I followed as a framework while independently assembling, testing, and debugging each subsystem to deepen my understanding of computer architecture.

## 🔧 Features Implemented
- **Clock Circuit** – stable and adjustable system clock
- **Registers** – A and B register as well as a flag register
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** – supports binary addition and subtraction
- **LED Output** – Represents bits
